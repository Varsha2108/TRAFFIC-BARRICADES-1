Electro-Hydraulic Bollard consists of 3 cylinders of same sizes viz. Bore Diameter (D): 32mm, Piston Rod diameter (d): 25 mm, Stroke Lengthfrom BDC to TDC (S): 760 mm. Stroke Timing (ST)from BDC to TDC & vice-versa: 5 seconds. TotalForce/Weight on 3 cylinders (F): 2.5 tons.
Cylinder calculations are as follows:
Area of Bore Side of each Cylinder:?? = ????
2
/4.
AB =
0.785*3.2*3.2 cm2
AB = 8.04
cm2
ABT = 3* AB
ABT = 3*8.04 cm2
ABT = 24.12 cm2
Area of Annulus Side of each Cylinder:  =

)/4.
AA =
0.785*(3.2*3.2-2.5*2.5) cm2
AA= 3.13 cm2
AAT = 3* AA
AAT = 3*3.13 cm2
AAT = 9.39 cm2
Volume required for each Cylinder: V =Area * Stroke Length.
Volume required on Bore Side of each cylinder:
VB=AB *S.
8.04 * 76 cm3
611.04 cm3 (Now 1 cm3 = .001 ltrs)
0.61 ltrs
For 3 nos. of Cylinders: VBT : VB *3 liters
VBT : 0.61*3 liters
VBT : 1.83 liters
Volume required on Bore Side of each cylinder:
AA*S.
3.13 * 76 cm3
237.88 cm3 (Now 1 cm3 = .001 liters)
0.238 liters
For 3 nos. of Cylinders: VAT : VA*3 liters
VAT : 0.238*3 liters
VAT : 0.71 liters
The three Cylinders have to operate within 5 seconds to lift the Bollard & to perform required safety operations. For this we need to provide the fluid to the Bore side of the Cylinder at a particular flow rate that could meet the function.
Similarly fluid needs to be admitted to Annulus side of the cylinder to retract the cylinder down. For this we will be requiring a Hydraulic oil Pump with a specific flow rate that could lift the cylinder up-to its full stroke length within the specified timing. Flow rate required to Lift/Retract the cylinders to full stroke length: (Volume/Stroke timing) liters per minute.
Flow Rate required to Lift the cylinders: QBT : VBT /T
(1.83 *60) /5 liters per minute
22 liters per minute.
Flow Rate required to retract the cylinders:
QAT: VAT / ST
(0.71 *60) /5 liters per minute 9 liters per
minute
Since the maximum Flow rate required is during Lifting hence the pump flow is selected according to the Lifting operation requirements. Also since it is a mechanical system there will be losses like slippage, leakages etc. which needed to be compensated & therefore a margin over the required flow rate is required.
We have considered 20% margin over the required
flow rate i.e.: Required flow rate * 1.20
22*1.20 liters per minute
26.4 liters per minute
Approx. 27 liters per minute.
he Pressure required to Lift the cylinders against the load is calculated using Pascalâ€™s Law which states that:
Pressure = (Force or Weight/Area) Kg/cm2 or bar
Hence, Pressure Require for Lifting the Cylinders:
PBT = Force/ ABT
PBT = 2500/24.12 Kg/Cm2
PBT = 103.6 Kg/Cm2
Due to mechanical System there will be some losses such as heat, pressure drop across valves & in Pipes/Tubes; we have taken 10% margin over the
required pressure for lifting.
Therefore the Design pressure is taken as: PD - PBT *
1.1
PD = 103.6*1.1 Kg/Cm2
PD = 115 Kg/Cm2
The Hydraulic Oil Pump can be of different types such as External Gear Pump, Vane Pump, variable displacement axial piston Pump, and Internal gear Pump etc. Any of these pumps can be used depending on the application of the system. Now for driving the Hydraulic oil pump we need an AC Electric Motor of a particular rating. The Motor rating depends upon three factors viz. Pressure, Flow & efficiency of the Pump.
Motor kW can be calculated by below given formula:
1. Motor Rating (kW):- (Pressure X Flow
rate)/(600 X Overall efficiency of Oil Pump)
Efficiency of Oil Pump varies from type to type:
1. Variable Displacement Axial piston pump
: 90%
2. External Gear Pump : 65%
3. Internal Gear Pump : 75%
